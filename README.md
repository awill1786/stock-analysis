# VBA Challenge Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the stock performances between the years of 2017 and 2018. Also we need to find the advantages and dis-advantages to refactoring the All Stock Analysis code in order to anaylaze the data.

As you can see it looks like besides the "TERP" and "RUN" stocks, every stock performed worse in 2018 than it did in 2017. The TERP stock is also the only stock of the group that had a negative return in both years, while the "ENPH" and "RUN" stocks are the only stocks to have a positive return in both years. The time it took for the original code to run was 0.8203125 seconds for 2017 and 2018.

#### Refactored Code
This refactored code I used to attempt to get a faster result.
